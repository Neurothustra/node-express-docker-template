# node-express-docker-template

A starter template for running a node/express app inside Docker.

## Getting Started

It's a simple app using node, typescript, nodemon to run inside of Docker Containers.

### Prerequisites

Since this uses Docker, you won't need anything locally installed other than Docker, and an understanding of what that requires to run locally (either docker machine or hyper-v for Windows).
