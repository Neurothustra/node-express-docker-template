# node-express-docker-template

A starter template for running a node/express app inside Docker.

## Getting Started

It's a simple app using node, typescript, nodemon to run inside of Docker Containers. There is a todo file that lists additional functionality that will be added.
CURRENTLY BREAKING - WILL FIX - run the docker-compose build command in the cli, then docker-compose up to start the server. To see it in the browser, add your system's IPv4 (find it with ipconfig)
then append the app's port, 8080

### Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) (not required if you can enable Hyper-V on Windows OS)
